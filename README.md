# MegaPong
A very basic one-player ponglike for Mega Drive/Genesis, developed in [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK).

This is in no way meant to be a fun and/or balanced gameplay experience. Instead, this is basically a sample project to show what a basic game developed in SGDK looks like, for those who want to learn Mega Drive development themselves. Some things could be solved in a more elegant way (by using structs, for example) but I wanted to keep this as simple as possible.

If you need some more help getting started, I've written a full tutorial [over on my website](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megapong/megapong-1/), along with many others!

### WARNING
I am very much a beginner, so some of the things you'll see in my code might be wrong or at the very least questionable. I very much welcome and appreciate feedback from people who actually know what they're doing!
